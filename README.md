## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+ (current setup may have compatibility issues with older versions)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Available Scripts

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run preview      # Preview production build

# Quality Assurance  
npm run lint         # Fix linting issues
npm run lint:check   # Check linting issues
npm run typecheck    # Run TypeScript compiler check
npm run test         # Run tests
npm run test:coverage # Run tests with coverage
```

## Key Business Logic

### Status Calculation
- **🟢 Healthy**: `stock > demand`
- **🟡 Low**: `stock = demand`  
- **🔴 Critical**: `stock < demand`

### Fill Rate Formula
```
Fill Rate = (sum(min(stock, demand)) / sum(demand)) * 100%
```

## Features Implemented

✅ **Dashboard Layout**
- Top bar with SupplySight branding and date range chips (7d/14d/30d)
- KPI cards showing key metrics
- Interactive line chart for trend visualization
- Advanced filtering system

✅ **Products Management**
- Paginated table (10 rows per page)
- Live search by name, SKU, or product ID
- Warehouse and status filtering
- Click-to-open product details drawer
- Update demand and transfer stock functionality

✅ **Data Interactions**
- GraphQL mutations for data updates with in-memory persistence
- Real-time KPI and chart updates when data changes
- Automatic data synchronization between GraphQL service and Redux store
- Real-time filtering and search
- Loading states and error handling
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

## API Structure

The mock GraphQL API includes:

### Queries
- `products` - Get all products
- `kpis(range: String!)` - Get KPIs for date range
- `trendData(range: String!)` - Get trend data for charts
- `warehouses` - Get list of all warehouses

### Mutations
- `updateProductDemand(productId: ID!, newDemand: Int!)` - Update product demand
- `transferStock(productId: ID!, amount: Int!)` - Transfer stock (positive or negative)

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests covering component rendering, business logic, and GraphQL operations. Tests have been updated to work with Redux state management instead of mocking GraphQL hooks.

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test file
npm test -- src/components/__tests__/KPICards.test.tsx
```

## Recent Updates

- ✅ **Fixed Mock Data Mutability**: Resolved read-only property issues with GraphQL mutations
- ✅ **Real-time UI Updates**: KPI cards and trend charts now automatically update when data changes
- ✅ **Data Synchronization**: Improved consistency between GraphQL service and Redux store
- ✅ **Test Infrastructure**: Updated test utilities to support Redux state and fixed TypeScript issues
- ✅ **Reactive Components**: Components now subscribe to Redux store for live data updates

## Known Issues

- Node.js version compatibility (requires 20.19+ or 22.12+)
- Development server may not start on older Node.js versions
